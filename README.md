# # # Maintenance

To add a blog post, go into the _posts folder and copy the formatting from one of the other blog posts, which all should be in markdown and simple to copy + modify.  Remember to modify the name with the correct date of the post, and to upload the preview photo, as well as any other photos you need, to the /assets/images/blog folder.

To add images to the image carousel on the main page or the history page, add images to the folders /assets/images/frontpage or /assets/images/history.

This website was made with love from scratch as a static site built with html/css/javascript, using jekyll functionalities through github sites.  For questions on the website, reach out to the resident science instructor at Cheeky Preparatory Academy.

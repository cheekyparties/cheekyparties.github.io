Principal Hayes got his start as a history teacher at Rivington Prep in 2010. Fresh out of grad school, his passion for visigoths and his warm-hearted nature made him a beloved figure amongst staff and students alike. In 2014, he was promoted to the dean of social sciences. While he enjoyed having a hand in developing the curriculum, he had a better look at how the administration addressed disciplinary issues. While his students were generally well-behaved in his class, he noticed a significant decline in good behavior since becoming a dean.

You see, dear reader, that same year, Rivington Prep decided to end corporal punishment. It was a tough decision, but the school board vote was 51 to 49. Mr. Hayes was was in favor of keeping corporal punishment — he felt that it was an effective, quick way to curb misbehavior. Without the threat of spankings, more students found themselves in detention, suspended from school, or in the principal's office. Test scores declined, and the quality of work the students put in decreased as well.

The following year, there was an opening for a new assistant principal. Mr. Hayes was offered the position and accepted it, hoping that he would be able to make greater impact on the students — and possibly convince the school board to change their minds. After another year, he saw slight improvements. Although he couldn't convince the school board to reinstate corporal punishment, he made it a point to lecture more students personally and encouraged teachers to do the same as opposed to simply assigning detentions. Mr. Hayes instituted other forms of discipline, such as mandatory essays and writing lines. However, he knew that none of these methods would ever be as effective as an old-fashioned spanking.

In the spring of 2015, Mr. Hayes attended a conference for educators in the northeast. There, he met Jeanine Grant, the former principal at Cheeky Preparatory. They hit it off, and Ms. Grant encouraged him to interview for the principal position. Ms. Grant planned to retire from school and pursue her dream of being a professional chef. Mr. Hayes interviewed for the job and was impressed with Cheeky Preparatory's eclectic range of classes, lively staff, and commitment to discipline. The superintendent was impressed with his dedication to shaping young minds and firm approach to education. The following semester, Ms. Grant retired, Mr. Hayes accepted the principal position, and from there – the rest is history.

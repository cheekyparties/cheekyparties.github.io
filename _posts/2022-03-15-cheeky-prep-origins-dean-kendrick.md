You may know Dean Kendrick from her firm lectures and the click of her heels in the hallway, but have you ever wondered what she was like before she became the dean of discipline? Learn more about her history in the second part of the riveting series, Cheeky Administrators: Before The Discipline.*

Many students have felt the dread of sitting in a hard wooden chair outside Dean Grace Kendrick's office. The less fortunate ones are familiar with the small desk inside it. But before she was gently passing out tissues in her office, Ms. Kendrick was handing out books at her local library.

Ms. Kendrick worked at Rivington Public Library as a page from high school through the end of college, where she double majored in literature and education. While she enjoyed the wide cast of people she met working at the library, she was excited for new opportunities, and she found a position as a literature teacher at Rivington Prep. Their budget was tight, so she also was occasionally the librarian. We aren't sure why or how this was even allowed, but no one seemed to mind. Ms. Kendrick was equally known for being strict on students with overdue library books, and for recommending the best stories.

She got along with all of her colleagues; but she was particularly good friends with Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes was promoted to dean of the history department shortly after Ms. Kendrick started working at Rivington Prep.

They first bonded one day when Mr. Hayes was working late. He had a flat tire and Ms. Kendrick was the only other person still there. She gave him a ride home and they lamented about the administration changes on the way. They were worried about the poor decorum of the students since the corporal punishment ban. At one point, Mr. Hayes asked Ms. Kendrick if she'd noticed an increase in overdue library books.

"Not at all," she said. "My words are powerful enough." While that was true, she still noticed more overall shenanigans. Some brave students waited exactly one day after their books were due to return them, just to see the twitch in her eye. Even though she couldn't use it the way she wanted to, she still kept a hairbrush on her desk.

A few months later, Ms. Kendrick and Mr. Hayes met for drinks after work. He told her about his plan to transfer schools. She was happy for him, but somewhat sad to be missing her favorite colleague, who had become a good friend. However, her disappointment faded once he told her they had an open position for a new dean…

*again, it's a working title. As in we're working on a better one.

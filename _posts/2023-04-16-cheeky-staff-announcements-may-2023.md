### Teachers

**Ms. Jay:** Ms. Jay returns as our English teacher. A longtime member of the Cheeky staff, Ms. Jay believes literature can bring out the best in her students. She takes a holistic approach to teaching, engaging her pupils not just through assigned material but through creative classwork that explores their hopes, fears, and dreams. And while she hates to employ negative consequences, she will not hesitate to correct a student that violates the safe classroom space. Ms. Jay takes learning seriously, and she expects her students to do the same.

**Mr. Guido:** Mr. Guido is a recent graduate from one of the country's most prestigious economics programs. He has agreed to accept the social studies position on short notice after Cheeky's longtime civics teacher, Dr. Houndstweed, was carried out to sea by vengeful jellyfish. While Mr. G's practical teaching experience has been limited, he is approaching the position with passion and deep learning. We wish him luck.

**Professor Reynolds:** After a decade at the college level, Dr. Reynolds returns to Cheeky Academy. Dr. Reynolds has published extensively in the fields of film theory and history; but their true passion lies in nurturing young scholars. They believe that how we view cinema is deeply connected to how we see the world. When not teaching, Dr. Reynolds practices bones and bone discovery at a semi-professional level.

**Dr. S.:** We are excited about our new science hire: Dr. S! Before joining the Cheeky staff, Dr. S. pursued an illustrious academic career in something that honestly sounds pretty complex and intense and is definitely way over our heads. We are excited for him to share this knowledge with our lucky students!

### Faculty

**Ms. Crawford:** Ms. Crawford returns as our dean of discipline. While she is often seeing students at difficult moments, she understands that even the act of discipline can be an opportunity to reinforce Cheeky's cherished values. Her extensive experience in correcting and directing misguided students is a priceless contribution to the academy. We say priceless because we have been forbidden by our board to reveal the actual price of these services. Not that Dean Crawford isn't worth every penny. She is! It's just, like, a lot of pennies. Like a lot. Like are there actually this many pennies in circulation?

**Ms. Angela:** Ms. Angela returns as our guidance counselor. Over the summer break, she completed the Tony Robbins Fellowship in Motivational Posturing. She believes that when it comes to influencing a student's choices, a healthy balance of positive and negative reinforcement is the best approach.

**Assistant Principal Dr. Gardner:** Scholar, administrator, mentor: Dr. Gardner is a man of many hats. But his true focus is on the lives and success of his students. Known for his open door policy as much as his high expectations, Dr. Gardner understands when to be a friend, and when a student needs more than just sympathy to achieve their goals. He sees potential in students that they sometimes can't even see in themselves. And he will bring it out of them, one way or another.

**Mrs. Em Hayes:** After years of toil at the assistant level, where she directly managed virtually every aspect of the academy's administrative and financial business, we are excited to announce Mrs. Hayes has been promoted to Director of Operations. In this role, she will directly manage virtually every aspect of the academy's administrative and financial business, but now she gets an office! Please note that while Mrs. Hayes does not deliver discipline herself, she will not hesitate to march miscreants right to a dean if they step out of line.

**Principal Hayes:** Principal Hayes believes in the students of Cheeky Academy. From the beginning, he has strove to foster an environment where young people can be challenged, nurtured, and supported as they transition to the next step in their lives. And yes, the number of students making it to that next step has been lower than he hoped. But his belief in the Cheeky approach has not wavered. Even though some level of wavering would be understandable. Like objectively, you could understand how wavering would happen. Like the graduation rate is LOW. But nope, not wavering. He is staying the course. Things will turn around.

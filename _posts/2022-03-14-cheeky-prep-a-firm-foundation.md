Cheeky Preparatory is a private school founded in 1972 by Alexander Cheelton and Kimberly Lexington. The two were former administrators and members of the Central Pennsylvania school board. They founded Cheeky because they noticed there was a shortage of schools with a healthy balance of progressive teachings and strict, old fashioned discipline.

Cheelton and Lexington developed Cheeky’s education modules with five core values in mind: personal responsibility, a passion for excellence, ethical process, diversity, and self discipline.

Personal Responsibility – We all make choices. Each student is responsible for their own actions and the consequences that stem from these actions.

Passion for Excellence – Our students are encouraged to strive for more than “good enough”. We want them to recognize their ability to excel.

Ethical Process – From a young age, people are taught the difference between right and wrong. We believe that no one is too old to learn this process, or to be firmly encouraged to do the right thing.

Diversity – We are committed to creating an environment where students can learn and excel regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background.

Self-Discipline – While we have several external methods we use to motivate students, our goal is to foster an environment in which students want to perform at their best – without the hand of an administrator or guardian present. Our hope is that they will learn to do the right thing and take positive action; in order to better themselves and those around them.

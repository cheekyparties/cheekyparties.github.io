Track team star. Debate team member. Loving boyfriend. Entrepreneur.

All of these are words that have been used to describe Ben L, the student we are honored to profile for our first ever Student Spotlight column!

For legal reasons we cannot technically get into that may or may not be related to a cryptocurrency scandal last spring, Ben L. will not be attending Cheeky this semester. However we already started writing this article before we received this information.

We believe in second, third, fourth, and fifth chances at Cheeky Preparatory.

Anyway, we had the pleasure of profiling Ben L. Even though he is studying at Oceanview Prep this semester, he said that he had all the time in the world to chat with us, because his only assignments this week were to "pick up the vibeiest seashell" and "make a Tik Tok of yourself skateboarding."

**What's your favorite thing about Cheeky Prep?**

Hello, you have reached the Rivertide Bluffs Federal Correctional Facility. At the moment, the prisoner you are trying to reach, Federal Inmate Number 13245-128, does not have sufficient funds in their account to take this call.

**What inspires you to do your best?**

As inmate #13245-128 does not have sufficient funds to take this call, I am only able to field any questions you have in relation to his sentence and incarceration, as per the Public Information Act of 1966.

**If you could give any advice to future students, what would it be?**

Inmate #13245-128 was found guilty of securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit fraud in Manhattan Federal Court.

**What's the biggest lesson you learned while attending Cheeky?**

Based on the data I have available, I would surmise that the "biggest lesson" Inmate #13245-128 learned was to not misrepresent the characteristics of a security (in this instance, a cryptocurrency that he created called "CheekyCoin"), with the intent to deceive the parents of his fellow students, and induce said parents to invest in said security.

**I'm still waiting to make a profit on that whole Cheekycoin thing, what's that all about?**

Based on current market values, an owner of "CheekyCoin" would hold a credit (or negative) balance of –$127,987.98 per coin. Have a nice day.

*Note from the Cheeky Staff: Ben is currently enrolled in a theater club at Oceanview Prep. Do not worry about the whole inmate thing.*

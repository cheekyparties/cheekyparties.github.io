        <h2>Spanking Parties & General Extra-ness</h2>
        <p>Remember that group of theater kids that took things a little too seriously? You couldn't talk to them before the show because they were ‘getting in the zone’, they were ‘in character’ at lunch…you were afraid they would literally hiss at you the opening night of Cats? Well that’s us, but add a little...kink. In short, we’re spankos that take roleplay very seriously. </p>
        <p>We host spanking parties with a focus on school/related immersive events that allow adults the full headspace - a day of classes, homework assignments, tests, and of course - punishments if you misbehave. At night, we open back up to a broader party for anyone just looking for some spanking fun - but don’t be surprised if you peep someone expanding on the earlier shenanigans of the morning’s events. You know what they say: spanked at school, spanked at home.</p>

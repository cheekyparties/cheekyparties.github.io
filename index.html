        <h2>Spanking Parties & General Extra-ness</h2>
        <p>We host spanking parties in downtown NYC -- with occasional events in the general Mid-Atlantic area -- with a focus on school/related immersive events that allow adults the full headspace - a day of classes, homework assignments, tests, and of course - punishments if you misbehave. At night, we open back up to a broader party for anyone just looking for some spanking fun - but don’t be surprised if you peep someone expanding on the earlier shenanigans of the morning’s events. You know what they say: spanked at school, spanked at home. For more on the lore and structure of Cheeky Preporatory Academy, view our <a href="/pages/history">history</a> page.</p>

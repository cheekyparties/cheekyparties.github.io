#Founded in 2016

Remember that group of theater kids that took things a little too seriously? You couldn't talk to them before the show because they were ‘getting in the zone’, they were ‘in character’ at lunch…you were afraid they would literally hiss at you the opening night of Cats? Well that’s us, but add a little...kink. In short, we’re spankos that take roleplay very seriously.

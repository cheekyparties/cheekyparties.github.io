# Ready To Attend Your First Cheeky Party?
â€‹
Before attending a Cheeky event, all guests must complete our vetting process. If you are new to our community, you can [begin the process here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNyt1Ty9pTPrYPeCptPrzoVUZkw4NT6I0dSMZNnmw-3E1RwQ/viewform).

Please keep in mind that members are accepted on a provisional basis. If new information comes to light we reserve the right to revoke attendance for any attendee. Cheeky vets members of the public for its parties but is not open to the public, an important distinction. No one who has not been fully vetted will be allowed to attend any party, at any time.
